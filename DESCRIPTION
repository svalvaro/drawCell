Description: The package drawCell allows the user the fast generation of cell 
                images with highlighted subcellular components. It works by 
                providing as input the taxonomy id of an organism, and one or
                multiple SL (Subcellular IDs). It retrieves this data from the
                SwissBioPics API. An internet connection is required to use
                drawCell.
